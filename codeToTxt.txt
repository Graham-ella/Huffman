First of all, we should conduct regular sampling and inspection of animals, 
so that people can understand the health of animals in a timely manner. 
If a disease does occur, we can know the first time. 
If it is a pet raised at home, it is more likely to be vaccinated 
because it has more opportunities for close contact with humans. 
For animals that are already sick, their therapeutic value is no longer great. 
We should kill them and treat them harmlessly. It is best to burn them to fundamentally stop the spread of germs. 
Moreover, the feed, secretions of sick animals, and the environment they have lived in must be completely sterilized.
 Secondly, in daily life, people who have the opportunity to come into direct contact with sick animals or the excrement 
and feed of sick animals should develop good hygiene habits. 
Wear work clothes and gloves when contacting animals. Sterilize your work clothes, and also disinfect your hands and feet.
 Don't let yourself be infected with germs because you are lazy.
